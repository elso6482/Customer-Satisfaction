# Customer Satisfaction

This project aims to identify the customer satisfaction from a customer survey. The survey scale ranges from 1 to 5 in six different areas, which 5 is the highest and 1 is the lowest.

Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers 
X1 = my order was delivered on time

X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order 
X4 = I paid a good price for my order 
X5 = I am satisfied with my courier 
X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me
